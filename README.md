# Groco
 A Web Template for a Grocery Store
 This Template has been made for grocery store.
 It is just the front-end. It is not complete. It was a good practice, though. Other necessary changes will be made and committed later.

 So far, there is just a single index which consists of the following sections
 1. Home
 2. Features
 3. Products
 4. Categories
 5. Review
 6. Blogs

This template is made fully responsive for different viewports.
